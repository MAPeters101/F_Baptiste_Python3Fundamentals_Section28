Question 2
Use the requests library to load the following html page:

url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann'
Once you have loaded that page, extract the title of that page, which is the
text located between the <title> and </title> tags (often referred to as
opening and closing tags, or start and end tags, respectively).

Hint: You'll want to read the Python docs for the find method available for
strings:
